#this how to create a set,dic and list . and how to use them 
# a={3,5,2,4,9,9,"hello","hello"}#this is setmade by {} 
# print(a)# string,int,float inside in set never repeat them self
# b=(3,"k",7,8,9,9)
# print(b)#in list made by () the string ,int,float inside repeat them self and they are mutable(changable)
# c=[5,6,3,"hello",3]
# print(c)#in tuple we can't change the data in the tuple but we can change them in list and set
# dic={"q":"f"}# the reasion why we use ,let me give you example of ,my project 47
